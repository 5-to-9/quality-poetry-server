# quality-poetry-server
Ever wanted your own endless supply of terrible poetry? Well, now you can get it, thanks to the Quality Poetry API.

Give the repo a download, install your dependancies, and gimme a pull request if you'd like to make any improvements.

To start the server, run
``` $ npm run start:dev ```

The app will attempt to start on port 3004.

Rupi Kaur, eat your heart out.
