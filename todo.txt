Todo:
* separate sounds into object-made and animal-made
* fun verbs and sad verbs
* endpoint for a specific line to be generated. IE qp.com/line?piece=middle
* improve word replacement function in generation_functions to search line for replacements instead of looping through all word types
* lop the "ly" off of adverbs to get phrases like "simple and often" instead of "simply and often"
* different types of poems
* targets for poems. IE "I", "you", "s/he"
* verbs have a trailing "e" removed if placed in "verbing"

Done:
* return the poem in a better JSON
* reorganize phrases.json so that phrases are only written once
* having a phrase as a title strips the punctuation
* phrases with feelings
* let app generate titles
* fill out title phrases
* phrases with body parts
* sort nouns into concrete and abstract
* stop words from being repeated in one phrase. IE don't allow something like "sorrow without pride is pride"
